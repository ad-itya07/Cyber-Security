The Initial dictionary contains a total of 910 different alphanumeric combinations.

In order to expand my dictionary, I made two variation on all the elements of the list.
    1. I swapped the case "one" letter at a time in each password and added the new combination formed in my list.
    2. I swapped the case of all the letters of a combination at once and added the new combination in my list.

After that in order to avoid any repitition of combinations, I converted the final list(after variation) into a set.

Hence, my final dictionary list contains a total of 6661 different combinations.
